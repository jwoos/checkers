# Checkers

## Build
You must have `go` installed as well as `dep`.

Built with the following:

```shell
% go version
go version go1.10 linux/amd64

% dep version
dep:
 version     : v0.4.1
 build date  : 2018-01-24
 git hash    : 37d9ea0a
 go version  : go1.9.1
 go compiler : gc
 platform    : linux/amd64
```

Refer to the following for installation:

- https://golang.org/doc/install
- https://github.com/golang/dep

You must also get a tool before continuing:

```
go get -v -u github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler/...
```
This should drop in an executable at `$GOPATH/bin` called `astilectron-bundler`.

Now you can build the actual application.

1. Move the directory to your `$GOPATH`

```shell
% mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/
# assuming directory is called project
% mv project $GOPATH/src/
```

2. Move to the directory

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/project
```

3. Pull down the dependency

```shell
% dep ensure
```

4. Run the bundler (this is required to build at all as it will generate embedded binary data as well as some missing methods)
   - This step only has to be run once unless the data that gets embedded changes (which it won't since you will be just building and not modifying)

```shell
% $GOPATH/bin/astilectron-bundler -v && chmod +x 
```

5. [OPTIONAL] Build it - this should place an executable in your directory with the same name as the directory

```shell
% go build
```

4. Run it
   - Linux: `build/linux-amd64/Checkers`
   - MacOS: `build/darwin-amd64/Checkers`
   - Windows: `build/windows-amd64/Checkers`

```shell
# again assuming the directory was called project and that you're going to run it on the current commputer
% ./project
# OR for bundled packages for different operating systems (tested only on Linux)
% ./build/linux-amd64/Checkers 
```

## Running

As stated above, there are several different outputs you can use. First and foremost is the output generated by `go build`. This will place an executable in the directory with name corresponding to the directory's name e.g. if you are in `project` and build it then it will result in an executable called `project` inside the `project` directory. This will be specific to the machine you build it on.

You can also use the builds provided by the bundler, which bundles together a binary for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. This will be in `build/$OS-amd64/Checkers` where `$OS` is one of `linux`, `darwin`, or `windows`. Be sure to use the proper executable for the proper operating system.

It's recommended that you run the bundler first and then just use the output of `go build`.

### Flags

The executable will show the different options available.

```shell
% ./project --help
Usage of ./project:
  -debug
    	Debug mode
  -depth int
    	Depth of minimax (default 16)
  -difficulty int
    	Difficulty indicated from 1 - 3 with 3 being the hardest (default 3)
  -first uint
    	Who should go first, 2 for human and 1 for ai (default 2)
  -gui
    	Initialize with a GUI
  -logger-app-name string
    	the logger's app name
  -v	if true, then log level is debug

```

## Using the library

Simply import the engine.

```go
import (
	"github.com/jwoos/go_checkers/engine"
)
```
